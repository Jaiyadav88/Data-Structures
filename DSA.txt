1.Matchstick game-Two friends, A and B, are playing the game of matchsticks. In this game, a group of N matchsticks is placed on the table. The players can pick any number of matchsticks from 1 to 4 (both inclusive) during their chance. The player who takes the last match stick wins the game. If A starts first, how many matchsticks should he pick on his 1st turn such that he is guaranteed to win the game or determine if it's impossible for him to win. Return -1 if it's impossible for A to win the game, else return the number of matchsticks should he pick on his 1st turn such that he is guaranteed to win.

2.Maximum index-Given an array A[] of N positive integers. The task is to find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] < A[j] and i < j.

11.Proof of Divisibility Rule of 3
We can prove the divisibility rule of 3 with the help of an example.
Consider the number 4368.
Let us expand this number as given below:
4368 = 4 × 1000 + 3 × 100 + 6 × 10 + 8 × 1
= 4 × (999 + 1) + 3 × (99 + 1) + 6 × (9 + 1) + 8 × 1
= (4 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 6 × 9) + (4 × 1 + 3 × 1 + 6 × 1 + 8 × 1)
= (4 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 6 × 9) + (4 + 3 + 6 + 8)
We know that 9, 99, 999,… are divisible by 3, and thus the multiples of these numbers are also divisible by 3.
So, the divisibility of 4368 is now dependent on the sum 4 + 3 + 6 + 8.
Here, 4, 3, 6 and 8 are the digits of the number 4368.
